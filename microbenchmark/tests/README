HOW TO RUN THE B-TREE TESTS
============================

There is a makefile in the directory.
To compille ALL tests, give "make all" in the terminal.
To compile them one-by-one:
	give "make test[1-8]" for simple tests 1 to 8 and,
	give "make mttest[1-11]" for multi-thread tests 1 to 11.
To run them one-by-one:
	give "make run[1-8]" for simple tests 1 to 8 and,
	give "make mtrun[1-11]" for multi-thread tests 1 to 11.
To delete all .cc files and executables, give "make clean"

PROBLEMATIC TESTS
==================

From the simple tests, test4 crashes intentionally.
It's a test to determine whenever the insert, find and delete
functions can handle NULL arguments.

From the multi-threaded ones, the ones who crash are
7, 8 and 11. All three of them perhaps have a problem
with the delete function. More details explained in mttest7.check

Also, mttest9, although it works properly, it MAY crash with a segmentation
fault, although this does not happen very often.

MISC
=====

You can modify testhdr.h to meet your enviroment (the PATHNAME and SIZE defines).
You can change the number of insertions INS_NUM as well.

Also, there are some warnings during compiling. You can ignore them.
