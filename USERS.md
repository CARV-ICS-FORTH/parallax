## [GekkoFS](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs)
GekkoFS is a file system capable of aggregating the local I/O capacity and performance of each compute node
in a HPC cluster to produce a high-performance storage space that can be accessed in a distributed manner.
This storage space allows HPC applications and simulations to run in isolation from each other with regards
to I/O, which reduces interferences and improves performance.
