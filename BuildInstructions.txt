Build Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CMake version 3.0.2 or greater is required to build this project.
On CentOS 7, you can install it from the epel repository with the command:
	sudo yum -y install cmake3
It can then be invoked with the cmake3 command.

Compilation is done using the clang compiler, provided by the clang package in
most Linux distributions.
To configure the build and compile on Centos 7 use (notice the dot in the first
command) in the root of the repository:
	cmake3 .
	make

Build Configuration Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CMake scripts provided support two build configurations; "Release" and
"Debug". The Debug configuration enables the "-g" option during compilation to
allow debugging. The build configuration can be defined as a parameter to the
cmake call as follows:
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug|Release" .

The default build configuration is "Debug".

Build Targets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* build/kreon/libkreon.a - Kreon library (standalone version)
* build/kreon/libkreonr.a - Kreon library with replication enabled
	(distributed version)
* build/TuRDMA/turdma.a - RDMA library used for applications and servers in the
	distributed version
* build/TucanaServer/libtuclient.a - Client library for applications talking to
	a tucanaserver
* build/TucanaServer/tucanaserver - Server
* build/YCSB-CXX/ycsb-edb - Standalone kreon ycsb benchmark
* build/YCSB-CXX/ycsb-kreon - Distributed kreon ycsb benchmark

Static Analyzer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the clang static analyzer with the command:
	sudo pip install scan-build

Before running the analyzer, make sure to delete any object files and
executables from previous build by running in the root of the repository:
	rm -r build

Then generate a report using:
	scan-build --intercept-first make

The last line of the above command's output will mention the folder where the
newly created report resides in. For example:
	"scan-build: Run 'scan-view /tmp/scan-build-2018-09-05-16-21-31-978968-9HK0UO'
	to examine bug reports."

To view the report you can run the above command, assuming you have a graphical
environment or just copy the folder mentioned to a computer that does and open
the index.html file in that folder.
